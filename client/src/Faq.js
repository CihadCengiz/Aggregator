    question: "How do you aggregate the data?",
    answer:
      "We made multiple scripts that run on a cron job that gathers data from multiple RSS feeds. After gathering the data, the script then forwards it to our Postgres database then we filter by a specific query that would filter all internships. Then after the filtering process, we render it on our front-end. Aside from that we also use other internship boards APIs to increase the value of our content.",
